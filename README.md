problem statement(
You need to print the computer values after performing the a book operations rounding of the results to two decimal places example                                                      input 3.5 2.0                                                                          output 7.00 1.75                                                                        e first line contains two phase separated floating point numbers nun1 and num2.
The first and contain result of multiplication of num1 and num2 rounded to two decimal places second one is the second line contain result of dividing num1 by num2 to decimal places if num 2 is non zero else print "undefined".
